# MyPortfolio

I created this portfolio because I was recently asked to present one and realized I did not have one. It was good practice for me as well as I learnt a new way to style div components using Tailwind which was fun.

## What I Learned

* Tailwind styling instead of creating seperate css files
* How to use smooth-scroll 
* How to make a website responsive
* How to connect a server to a contact form
